# Status

We apply for the **reusable** badge. We believe that our artifact fulfills the criteria for this badge for the following reasons:
1. It is available for public use [here](https://github.com/iotuser22/iotcheck-data).
2. It is documented carefully with [relevant information and instructions](https://github.com/iotuser22/iotcheck-data/blob/master/README.md).
3. It contains the detailed results (along with summary files); all the details can be checked and found to be consistent with the results we have presented in our paper.
4. It contains (along with the manual study results) the automated conflict detection results that are reproducible using the [released IoTCheck](https://github.com/iotuser22/iotcheck).
5. Its consistency and reproducibility (with the use of [IoTCheck](https://github.com/iotuser22/iotcheck)) could help spawn and facilitate future research in the new area of conflict detection for smart home apps. Thus, this artifact is appropriate to reuse and repurpose.
