# Status

We apply for the **reusable** badge. We believe that our artifact fulfills the criteria for this badge for the following reasons:
1. It is available for public use by following the instructions to install Vagrant [here](https://github.com/iotuser22/iotcheck-vagrant) and IoTCheck [here](https://github.com/iotuser22/iotcheck). Its installation and usage are simple and compact: one has to install Vagrant and run a setup script to finish the IoTCheck installation, then one or two example command lines to test the installation. The same script facilitates rerunning and reproducing our experiments easily.
2. It is documented carefully with [installation instructions for Vagrant](https://github.com/iotuser22/iotcheck-vagrant/blob/master/README.md), [installation instructions for IoTCheck](https://github.com/iotuser22/iotcheck/blob/master/README.md), and [IoTCheck Wiki](https://github.com/iotuser22/iotcheck/wiki) that provides more detailed explanation to supplement the description we have in the paper (see **Section 7**). The technical aspects about how the components are connected with one another are documented thoroughly. We believe that everything is written carefully and well-structured enough to facilitate reuse and repurposing.
3. It can be installed and used to reproduce the results we have presented in the paper. We have also [released the detailed results of our experiments here](https://github.com/iotuser22/iotcheck-data). Rerunning IoTCheck will produce consistent results that can be checked against the released detailed results. This facilitates the reuse of IoTCheck to support future research in the area of conflict detection of smart home apps.
