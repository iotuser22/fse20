# Status

We apply for the **functional** badge. We believe that our artifact fulfills the criteria for this badge for the following reasons:
1. It is available for public use by following the instructions to install Vagrant [here](https://github.com/iotuser22/iotcheck-vagrant) and IoTCheck [here](https://github.com/iotuser22/iotcheck).
2. It is documented carefully with [installation instructions for Vagrant](https://github.com/iotuser22/iotcheck-vagrant/blob/master/README.md), [installation instructions for IoTCheck](https://github.com/iotuser22/iotcheck/blob/master/README.md), and [IoTCheck Wiki](https://github.com/iotuser22/iotcheck/wiki) that provides more detailed explanation to supplement the description we have in the paper (see **Section 7**).
3. It can be installed and used to reproduce the results we have presented in the paper. We have also [released the detailed results of our experiments here](https://github.com/iotuser22/iotcheck-data). Rerunning IoTCheck will produce consistent results that can be checked against the released detailed results.
